# ML4ES-sandbox

This is the sandbox for the reopistory [ML4ES-tutorials](https://github.com/geo-yrao/ML4ES-tutorials) to set up binder environment to 
avoid frequent change caused by notebook content change.

The configuration file will only be updated when new packages are required for the notebooks.
